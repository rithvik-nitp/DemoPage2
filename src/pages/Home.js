                NIT Patna prides itself on the success of its alumni. After
                successfully completing their academic years at the institute,
                our alumni went on to expand their wings and reached new
                heights, be it as entrepreneurs, industrialists, academicians,
                researchers, social cause champions, bureaucrats etc. We have
                had many notable alumni who have received national and
                international recognition in their respective professional
                fields. With more than 45000 alumni spanning across the globe,
                they have been instrumental in strengthening the image of NIT
                Patna.

                Though their dreams took them in new directions, BCE-NITP alumni
                have always felt connected to their alma mater and hence, they
                have over the years nurtured the institute through their
                generous contributions. The spirit of Giving Back is reflected
                in every corner of the institute be it infrastructure
                development, scholarships, especially to girl students,
                financial support to various hobby clubs, set-up of different

                It is my pleasure to introduce one of the oldest Technological
                Institutes of North India, National Institute of Technology
                Patna, whose history goes back to 1876 when four survey schools
                were established in Dacca, Hoogly, Cuttack and Patna. The
                schools at Hoogly and Cuttack failed but those at Dacca and
                Patna continued to prosper. In 1882, a separate altogether,
                named as Bihar Industrial School, was opened in the premises of
                the survey school in Patna college campus.{" "}
              </p>
              <p align="justify">
                In July 1886, these two separate institutions were merged and
                given the name of Bihar School of Engineering under the
                leadership of Mr. A Ewbank, the then principal of Patna College.
                Between 1892 and 1902, a functional building which is at present
                the main administrative building of NIT Patna, was built with
                Rs. 100,000/- donation from Nawab Lulf Ali Khan of Patna City.{" "}
              </p>
              <p align="justify">
                The balance amount of Rs. 38,000/- came from the Prince of Wales
                reception fund. Prof. C. R. Walford was the Principal of this
                college from 1900 to 1926. In 1924, the engineering school
                upgraded to Bihar College of Engineering under Patna University.
                In 2004, MHRD, Government of India upgraded Bihar College of
                Engineering to National Institute of Technology Patna and in
                2007 it came under the act ‘NIT Act 2007’and declared Institute
                of National Importance.
              </p>

              <p align="justify">
                At present NIT Patna is offering undergraduate programs (B. Tech
                & B. Arch) and Post graduate program (M. Tech & MRUP) along with
                Ph.D. Programs. Total number of students is nearly 3000. The
                institute has state-of-art laboratories, in each department.
                This great institute has produced large number of alumni who
                served the nation with distinction like Mr. M. B. Verma, former
                Program Director of Prestigious LCA Project of DRDO, Dr. Ratan
                K. Sinha, Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission of India, Mr. C.
                Prasad, Ex. D G CPWD to name a few. The Institute has a very
                active linkage industry from its inception. Different PSUs are
                awarding scholarships to our students. The institute is going to
                sign MoU with FICCI and CII for collaboration soon. All our
                passed out graduates are serving the Indian Industry and PSUs
                with distinction. I wish the Institute all the success.
